# culpa-cache React App

Created by: [Richard Shin](https://www.rshin.dev/)

This project exists to preserve the thousands of reviews that was hosted on CULPA, the unofficial professor and course review site for Columbia University. Around the summer of 2021 the site started becoming inaccessible and thousands of reviews going as far back as 1998 were in danger of being lost forever. 

This project is broken up into three parts: the [Scraper](https://github.com/rshin7/culpa-cache-scraper), the [API](https://github.com/rshin7/culpa-cache-api), and the React App.

This portion of the project contains the actual front end server where users can view and search through reviews in an easy to use, responsive interface.
